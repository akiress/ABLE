        <p id="about">ABLE aims to facilitate the use of interactive, educational gaming applications that provide
          supplementary assistance for the learning and review processes that take place outside of the classroom. The
          ultimate vision is to supply a variety of entertaining, informative game-based programs that both students and
          instructors will want to use. The main goal of this project is to develop these programs and make them widely
          available for little or no cost to use.

      <p id="aboutheaders">Overview</p>
      <p id="about">Applications for Basic Learning and Education (ABLE) is a web-based collection of interactive
        educational programs that provide engaging and entertaining ways to supplement learning outside of the
        classroom.
      </p>
      <p id="about">Educational institutions, extracurricular tutoring organizations, and involved parents are
        constantly searching for new ways to assist learning and reviewing material beyond the restraints of regular
        school hours. This search is made far more difficult by students’ reluctance to participate in activities
        that they perceive as being tedious or overly time-consuming.
      </p>
      <p id="about">Over the years various educational games have been created to fulfill this need for tasks that are
        both interesting and informative. The computer-based educational game market seemed to peak in the 1990s, with
        numerous learning-based software applications being sold primarily in the form of CDs. However, as the Internet
        became more accessible and information became more readily available, both the quantity and quality of
        educational applications experienced a severe decline.
      </p>   
      <p id="about">A few major businesses, such as Leapfrog and The Learning Company, still focus on producing
        educational games; however, the relative rarity of these programs, the market’s desire for them, and the level 
        of work needed to produce a successful product often combine to cause these applications to have very high 
        consumer prices. Additionally, the majority of educational games currently available are geared specifically 
        towards young children who are just beginning their educations and focus on only one subject, such as
        mathematics or reading skills, per application.
      </p>
      <p id="about">The primary focus of ABLE is to address these pain points by making high-quality educational games 
        which are easily accessible to the public. We will accomplish this by being web-based, which allows for ABLE to 
        be accessed from an immeasurable number of different devices and locations, and by making general use of ABLE 
        free to the public. Upon completion ABLE will possess a wide variety of learning-based applications that range 
        in topics from general learning skills to specific subjects. ABLE will also cater to far more varied age ranges,
        with games directed for almost any level of education.
      </p>
      <p id="about">We develop our software using free and open source technologies to minimize the cost of production. 
        Additional profit will be gained upon completion of the project by making certain features only available to 
        users who have memberships or through donations.
