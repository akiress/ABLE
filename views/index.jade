        | Applications for Basic Learning and Education (ABLE) is a web-based collection of interactive educational
        | programs that provide engaging and entertaining ways to supplement learning outside of the classroom.
      p#para2
        | Educational institutions, extracurricular tutoring organizations, and involved parents are constantly
        | searching for new ways to assist learning and reviewing material beyond the restraints of regular school hours.
        | This search is made far more difficult by studentsâ€™ reluctance to participate in activities that they perceive
        | as being tedious or overly time-consuming.
